Rate your mood and leave a sentence if you like. Access your mood progression over the year through a beautifully designed chart.

## Features

- **Daily Mood Check**: A simple, non-intrusive notification asking you about your mood.
- **Randomized Questions**: The question changes every day to keep the interaction engaging.
- **Mood Rating**: Rate your mood on a scale from 1 to 5.
- **Optional Sentence**: Leave a brief note or sentence about why you feel the way you do.
- **Yearly Progression Chart**: Visualize your mood over the year to gain insights into your emotional health.
